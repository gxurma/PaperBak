<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. What is PaperBack?</span><br>
<br>
PaperBack is a free application that allows you to back up your
precious files on the ordinary paper in the form of the oversized
bitmaps. If you have a good laser printer with the 600 dpi resolution,
you can save up to 500,000 bytes of uncompressed data on the single
A4/Letter sheet. Integrated packer allows for much better data density
- up to 3,000,000+ (<span style="font-weight: bold;">three megabytes</span>)
of C code per page.<br>
<br>
You may ask - why? Why, for heaven's sake, do I need to make paper
backups, if there are so many alternative possibilities like CD-R's,
DVD&plusmn;R's, memory sticks, flash cards, hard disks, streamer tapes,
ZIP drives, network storages, magnetooptical cartridges, and even
8-inch double-sided floppy disks formatted for DEC PDP-11? (I still
have some). The answer is simple: you don't. However, by looking on CD
or magnetic tape, you are not able to tell whether your data is
readable or not. You must insert your medium into the drive (if you
have one!) and try to read it.<br>
<br>
Paper is different. Do you remember the punched cards? EBCDIC and all
this stuff. For years, cards were the main storage medium for the
source code. I agree that 100K+ programs were... <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unhandly</span>, but hey, only real
programmers dared to write applications of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">this</span> size. And used cards were good
as notepads, too. Punched tapes were also common. And even the most
weird codings, like CDC or EBCDIC, were readable by humans (I mean, by
real programmers).<br>
<br>
Of course, bitmaps produced by PaperBack are also human-readable (with
the small help of any decent microscope). I'm joking. What you need is
a scanner attached to PC. Actual version is for Windows only, but it's
free and open source, and there is nothing that prevents you from
porting PaperBack to Linux or Mac, and the chances are good that it
still will work under Windows XXXP or Trillenium Edition. And, of
course, you can mail your printouts to the recipients anywhere in the
world, even if they have no Internet access or live in the countries
where such access is restricted by the regiment.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, a scanner. For 600 dpi printer you will need a scanner with at
least 900 dpi physical (let me emphasize, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">physical</span>, not <span
 style="font-style: italic;">interpolated</span>) resolution.<br>
<br>
Have I already mentioned that PaperBack is free? I release it under the
GNU General Public License, version 3. This means that you pay nothing
for the program, that the sources are freely available, and that you
are allowed - in fact, encouraged - to modify and improve this
application.<br>
<br>
<a name="2"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Installation.</span><br>
<br>
You don't need to install PaperBack. Copy it to any directory, if
possible, with unrestricted write access (to allow PaperBack to save
settings to the initialization file), optionally create shortcut on the
desktop - that's all.<br>
<br>
<a name="3"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Setup.</span><br>
<br>
This is how Options dialog looks:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="options.gif" title=""
 alt="Options dialog" style="width: 389px; height: 253px;"><br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
The most important setting is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">dot
density</span>. It determines the size of the data bit on the paper and
must be at least two times lower than the physical resolution of your
printer. For example, if you are the (moderately) happy owner of the HP
LaserJet V with 600 dpi resolution, set density to 300 dpi. This allows
you to draw 300x300=90,000 dots, or slightly less than 6 k bytes of
useful data on every square inch of the paper. <br>
<br>
Jet printers are not as good as laser. Maximal useful resolution is
typically limited to 200 dpi. Please select the best available quality,
and don't forget to align the printing nozzles, so that points printed
from left to right coincide with those printed from right to left. <br>
<br>
Dots must be clearly distinguishable from each other. Usually this
means that they must be separated by some anount of white space,
determined by the parameter <span style="font-weight: bold;">dot size</span>.
70% is usually the best option.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compression</span> is always good,
because it reduces the size of the bitmap, unless your file is already
packed. Use fast compression if your computer is really, really slow,
and maximal compression in all other cases. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Redundancy</span> helps to recover
partially damaged data. Redundancy 1:5 means that for every 5
consecutive data blocks, if one block is completely unreadable,
PaperBack will be able to restore it. To reduce damages caused by
coffee pots and other common dangers, blocks are distributed around the
page. Higher redundancy decreases page capacity but improves
reliability.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Header and footer</span> asks
PaperBack to print useful information about the file, like file name,
its size, date of last modification, page and recommended scanner
settings. This parameter influences only the printing and has no
influence on the reading of the data. Border around the page improves
autocropping with the not-so-smart TWAIN drivers.<br>
<br>
Large files will be printed on several pages. When last page is scanned
(order is not important) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">autosave</span>
option is activated, PaperBack will ask you to select location where
restored file will be saved. If this option is unchecked, you must
press Save button when recognition is finished - convenient if your
scanner has automatical feeder and you scan several backups (up to 5)
at once.<br>
<br>
PaperBack uses Highly Sophisticated Unbelievably Advanced Error
Correction Techniques (in fact, Reed-Solomon ECC) to restore unreadable
pixels. Therefore, if data is halfway readable, it will accept it, even
if recognition parameters are very far from optimal. This accelerates
processing but leads to the high amount of bad blocks reported by the
program. When you backup important data and verify it afterwards, this
may lead to false assumption that data is unreliable. But activate <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Determine best quality</span>, and
PaperBack will report the real data quality. Of course, this costs time.<br>
<br>
Two last options set data encryption (FIPS-197 compliant AES is not
easy to crack) and whether password is displayed as the readable text
while you type it in, or the characters are replaced by asterisks. Of
course, this option does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
mean that password will be printed on the paper!<br>
<br>
<a name="4"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Printing data to paper.</span><br>
<br>
First, set page size and printer options. They may differ from one
driver to another, so I will not discuss them here in details. Always
select the best available printing quality. Turn off halftoning,
dithering and image optimization. Don't forget to align nozzles on jet
printers; if possible, turn off bidirectional printing. Note that only
basic printer options are saved between the sessions, and you may need
to re-enter them again.<br>
<br>
After options are set, you can print your data. Current PaperBack
version is 1.00, and it can't backup folders - only the single files,
at most one per page. This is the very substantial drawback for the
backup program. If you are going to save many small files, better first
pack them into the single archive using WinZip, tar or similar program.
<br>
<br>
PaperBack supports drag-and-drop. If file has extention other than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.bmp</span>, it will be printed. Default
action for bitmaps is the recognition. To&nbsp; backup them, use Print
button. You can drop several files at once; internal queue is limited
to 128 entries. Again, each file will be printed on the separate
sheet(s) of paper.<br>
<br>
For test purposes, you can save bitmaps to the disk. This option is
selectable from the main menu.<br>
<br>
<a name="5"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Data restoration.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
PaperBack should support any scanner with TWAIN interface. It also
accepts uncompressed grayscale and RGB bitmaps with 8 or 24 bits per
pixel. You can drag-and-drop files with extention <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.bmp</span> directly into the PaperBack.<br>
<br>
If you use scanner, select scanning source from the main menu, then
press Scan button. Optimal resolution is about 3 times the dot density.
B/W scans are usually unreadable, always select grayscale image. Color
scanning is also acceptable, but has no advantages except for 3-fold
memory use. (Another joke). Memory requirements are relatively high. A4
grayscale bitmap with 900 dpi resolution requires around 80 MB.<br>
<br>
Turn off all image optimizations, like sharpening - PaperBack uses its
own optimization techniques better suitable for this particular case.<br>
<br>
Grid should be more or less parallel to the sides of the scanner
(maximal angle must not exceed &plusmn;7&deg;), but general orientation
is unimportant: portrait, landscape, upside down or even, if you use
transparencies, flipped. Orientation may change from one paper sheet to
another. <br>
<br>
You can scan up to 5 backups simultaneously. Each file will be placed
into the separate tab. If backup consists of several pages, the order
in which they are scanned is absolutely unimportant. Bottom line in the
tab displays list of unscanned or incomplete pages. If some page is
unreadable, change its placement, resolution and/or brightness and
contrast.<br>
<br>
Quality map to the right shows distribution of errors on the last
scanned page as a gradations of colours. Good blocks are green. The
higher the number of erroneous bytes, the more reddish is the colour.
Undeciphereble blocks with more than 16 invalid bytes are black. If
block is white, PaperBack was unable to recognize the grid. Doubleclick
map to display the block as a grayscale image (optionally with marked
errors).<br>
<br>
After all pages are scanned, press on Save to write restored file to
the disk. If backup is encrypted, you will be asked to enter the
password.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">6. History.</span><br>
<br>
Once upon a time, my oldest son (he was 15 then) asked me: "Dad, how
the huge amounts of data are saved on the small CD?" A brief
explanation from my side followed, I took a very sharp pencil and tried
to draw as small points and lines as possible, in order to emphasize
how dense the data is. Then my son asked: "How much data can you place
this way on the single sheet of paper?" My estimation was in the order
of 100 K. "Can we make a try?" It took me four or five days to make the
proof of concept, and another two weeks to integrate packer, encryption
and user interface. Then I lost the interest and put the whole project
into the darkest corner of the deepest directory on my hard disk. (One
more joke). But why keep potentially useful code to myself? So now I am
releasing it under GPL 3.<br>

PaperBack is a "clean-room" implementation. I assure that my part of
code is written by myself alone and is not based on any 3-rd party work.<br>
<br>
However, I can't guarantee that this program doesn't infringe any
patents, trade marks or other stuff that makes lawyers rich. If you are
going to use PaperBack, all the burden of proof is
on your side. <br>
